## Project: *Spline regression on WMAP data*

## Content description
This repository contains the first homework project of Statistical Learningduring the accademic year 2022/2023 [master degree in Data Science](http://datascience.i3s.uniroma1.it/it) in Sapienza University of Rome.

The goal of the project is to estimate an unknown function $f(X)$
 in order to predict the response variable $Y$
 from independent data $(X1,Y1)â€¦,(Xn,Yn)$ via spline regression model
